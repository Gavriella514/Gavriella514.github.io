    <h2> Why? </h2>

    <h3> Just so many reasons </h3>

        <em><strong>Here's a list (and some other random shit)</strong></em>

        Maybe you and me were never meant to be. But baby think of me once in awhile. I'm at WKRP in Cincinnati! Well we're movin' on up to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. On the most sensational inspirational celebrational <em>Muppetational</em>â€¦ This is what we call the Muppet Show. They're creepy and they're kooky mysterious and spooky. They're all together ooky the Addams Family. Sunny Days sweepin' the clouds away. On my way to where the air is sweet. Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame Street.

        <strong>Thank you for being a friend. Travelled down the road and back again. </strong> Your heart is true you're a pal and a confidant. Its mission - to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no man has gone before. Texas tea. All of them had hair of gold like their mother the youngest one in curls. The year is 1987 and NASA launches the last of Americas deep space probes. Come and dance on our floor. Take a step that is new. We've a loveable space that needs your face threes company too. Come and knock on our door. We've been waiting for you. Where the kisses are hers and hers and his. Three's company too.

        Sunday Monday Happy Days. Tuesday Wednesday Happy Days. Thursday Friday Happy Days. <em><strong>Saturday what a day.</strong></em> Groovin' all week with you. Till the one day when the lady met this fellow and they knew it was much more than a hunch. <em> Baby if you've ever wondered - wondered whatever became of me.</em> I'm living on the air in Cincinnati. Cincinnati WKRP.
